	<h1>HPE</h1>
	<p>The Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (HPE) is an American multinational enterprise information technology company based in Houston, Texas, United States.

	HPE was founded on November 1, 2015, in San Jose, California, as part of the splitting of the Hewlett-Packard company. It is a business-focused organization which works in servers, storage, networking, containerisation software and consulting and support. On October 31, HPE reported FY2019 annual revenue of $29.135 billion, down 5.57% from the prior year period.

	The split was structured so that the former Hewlett-Packard Company would change its name to HP Inc. and spin off Hewlett Packard Enterprise as a newly created company. HP Inc. retained the old HP's personal computer and printing business, as well as its stock-price history and original NYSE ticker symbol for Hewlett-Packard; Enterprise trades under its own ticker symbol: HPE. According to notes from 2015, HPE's revenue was slightly less than that of HP Inc. In 2017, it spun off its Enterprise Services business and merged it with Computer Sciences Corporation to become DXC Technology. It also spun off its software business and merged it with Micro Focus. HPE was ranked No. 107 in the 2018 Fortune 500 list of the largest United States corporations by total revenue.</p>
